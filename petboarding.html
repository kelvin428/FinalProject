                K&M Pet Service ensures your peace of mind with 24/7 supervision for your pup while you’re away. Our
                professional attendants are on-site day and night, making sure each pet in our care enjoys a healthy and
                safe experience. Daily digital report cards keep you up-to-date on how your furry pal is doing, and you
                can be a part of your pet’s stay using our live HD webcams. </p>

                Professional Care You Can Count On
            </h2>
            <p>
                Whether your pet requires a special diet or medication, our team is here to help. K&M Pet Service’s
                trained attendants facilitate socialization and play for your pet, while providing the kind of structure
                your pet needs when away from home. We make sure to set aside plenty of time for rest, meals, and
                cooldowns throughout your pet’s stay. </p>

            <h2>Bring Home a Happy, Clean Pup</h2>
            <p>Our on-site grooming and bathing areas allow you to add a bath or grooming session to the end of your
                pet’s stay with us. After days of romping and fun, we’ll make sure your pup gets a soothing spa session.
                What better way to come home than with memories of playtime and a fresh, new ‘do?</p>

                What to Know Before You Board
            </h2>
            <p>
                pets can be dropped off and picked up for boarding between the hours of 7am — 9pm on weekdays or 9am —
                7pm on weekends. We provide beds, blankets, and toys for your pet’s stay with us. All you need to bring
                is your pup! If you are bringing food from home for your pet, please have it in a clearly labeled
                container, with enough portions for their entire stay. Any medications we need to administer should be
                brought in their original containers or packaging; do not mix them into your pet’s food. If you and your
                pet are new to K&M Pet Service, we recommend a few days of daycare in advance of a boarding stay. This
                gives your pet a chance to become comfortable and familiar with the environment at K&M Pet Service and
                lets us get to know your pup. </p>
